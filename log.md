* rawpixelsbackgoundsv3 - I can get .2629 loss with just background and 3 epochs, with 1 epoch I got around .4, I wonder if I increase epochs to 8 will it increase more. next I want to introduce 1 shape with a background color, I will try that next
* rawpixelsbackgoundsv4 - will loss continue to go down?
